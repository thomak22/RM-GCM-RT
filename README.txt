This repository is an isolated version of the RM-GCM's radiative transfer routine, documented in Malsky et al. 2024 and the references therein. Briefly, it uses the two-stream algorithm for multiple scattering inhomogeneous atmospheres of Toon+1989 to calculate fluxes and heating rates with either double-gray or picket-fence opacities, and uses those heating rates to evolve atmospheric temperatures. This version is meant for fast calculations of the 1-D radiative equilibrium of individual columns self-consistently with the parent 3-D code. It is compiled and run with the same input file, with an additional 2 inputs; "MUSTEL", the cosine of the stellar incident angle you want, and "ISF" (incident starlight fraction), the fraction of the substellar point irradiation flux received by the point in question. These are typically identical for a real column of atmosphere receiving collimated stellar radiation, but you can set MUSTEL to 1/sqrt(3.) and ISF to either 0.25 or 0.5 to get an approximate global or dayside temperature average, if desired (see e.g. Guillot+2011), which motivates their being separate inputs.

Unlike typical radiative equilibrium codes, which explicitly iterate toward radiative equilibrium (and don't care about time), this code is fully time-dependent due to its origins in a climate model (but, as with GCMs, we expect it to find a quasi-steady state). Distinct from the RM-GCM itself, RM-GCM-RT currently uses an explicit first-order Euler timestepping scheme with adaptive timestepping such that |dT/dt| / T never exceeds 0.05% in a single time step for any layer.

To-dos:
- ~~Get the 1-D code working, benchmark against analytic double-gray profiles~~
- Add convective adjustment scheme, currently pure radiative transport (present in the RM-GCM already)
- Add correlated-k opacity implementation in addition to existing double-gray and picket-fence opacities (work mostly done for 3-D code but need to port over)
